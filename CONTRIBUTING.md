## üöÄ Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project running, follow these simple steps.

1.  **Fork and Clone:** Fork the repository on GitLab and clone your fork to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone https://code.swecha.org/nikhilesh9ix/versevaani.git
    cd versevaani
    ```

2.  **Install uv:** We use `uv` for fast Python package management. Install it first:
    ```bash
    # On macOS and Linux
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    
    # On Windows
    powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    
    # Or with pip
    pip install uv
    ```

3.  **Set up Development Environment:** Use our development scripts:
    ```bash
    # Unix/Linux/macOS
    make dev
    
    # Windows PowerShell
    .\dev.ps1 dev
    ```

4.  **Set up Environment Variables:** You will need an OpenRouter API key.
    - Go to [OpenRouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai) to get your API key.
    - Create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add your key:
    ```env
    OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-...
    ```

5.  **Run Tests:** Ensure everything works:
    ```bash
    # Unix/Linux/macOS
    make test
    
    # Windows PowerShell
    .\dev.ps1 test
    ```

6.  **Run the App:** Start the Streamlit application:
    ```bash
    # Unix/Linux/macOS
    make run
    
    # Windows PowerShell
    .\dev.ps1 run
    ```

## üìú Contribution Workflow

### Development Workflow

1.  Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature`.
2.  Make your changes following our code standards (see below).
3.  Format and lint your code:
    ```bash
    # Unix/Linux/macOS
    make format

    .\dev.ps1 test
    ```
5.  Commit your changes with a descriptive message: `git commit -m "feat: add my cool feature"`.
6.  Push your branch to your forked repository: `git push origin feature/my-cool-feature`.
7.  Open a new Merge Request on the main repository and describe your changes.

### Code Standards

We use **Ruff** for code formatting and linting. Please ensure your code follows these standards:

- **Formatting**: Run `make format` or `.\dev.ps1 format` before committing
- **Linting**: Run `make lint` or `.\dev.ps1 lint` to check for issues
- **Type Hints**: Add type hints to all function parameters and return values
- **Docstrings**: Document all classes and methods with Google-style docstrings
- **Testing**: Add tests for new functionality
