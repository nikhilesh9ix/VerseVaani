   # On macOS and Linux
   curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
   
   # On Windows
   powershell -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
   
   # Or with pip
   pip install uv
   ```

3. **Set up Development Environment:** Use our development scripts:

   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   make setup
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\dev.ps1 setup
   ```

4. **Set up Environment Variables:** You will need an OpenRouter API key.

   ```env
   OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
   ```

5. **Run Tests:** Ensure everything works:

   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   make test
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\dev.ps1 test
   ```

6. **Run the App:** Start the Streamlit application:

   ```bash
   # Unix/Linux/macOS
   make run
   
   # Windows PowerShell
   .\dev.ps1 run
   ```

## üìã Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/my-cool-feature`.
2. Make your changes following our code standards (see below).
3. Test your changes: `./dev.ps1 test` or `make test`.
4. Format and lint your code: `./dev.ps1 format` or `make format`.
5. Commit your changes with a descriptive message.
6. Push to your fork and create a Merge Request on GitLab.

## üéØ Code Standards

We maintain high code quality standards. Please ensure your contributions follow these guidelines:

### Code Quality Tools

- **Formatting:** We use `ruff format` for consistent code formatting
- **Linting:** We use `ruff check` for code quality checks
- **Type Checking:** We use `mypy` for static type analysis
- **Testing:** We use `pytest` for comprehensive test coverage

### Quick Quality Check

Before submitting your PR, run:

```bash
# Windows
.\dev.ps1 lint

# Unix/Linux/macOS  
make lint
```

This will run all quality checks (formatting, linting, type checking).

### Code Style Guidelines

- **Type Hints:** Add type hints to all public functions and methods
- **Documentation:** Add docstrings to all public functions and classes
- **Error Handling:** Include comprehensive error handling with meaningful messages
- **Testing:** Write tests for new functionality
- **Comments:** Use clear, concise comments to explain complex logic

## üß™ Testing

We maintain comprehensive test coverage. When adding new features:

1. **Write Tests First:** Consider using Test-Driven Development (TDD)
2. **Test Coverage:** Aim for high test coverage on new code
3. **Test Types:** Include unit tests for individual functions and integration tests for workflows

Run tests with:

```bash
# Basic test run
uv run pytest

# Test with coverage report
uv run pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```
